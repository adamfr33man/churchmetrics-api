# Users

Users on your account can be assigned to a role and campus. 

## Roles

### Admins

Admins have full access to all data and settings for the account. If the user is assigned the "admin" role, they will not be assigned to any campus.

### Staff

Staff users are assigned to a particular campus. They can input data for up to 6 days after the service time. They do not have access to Church settings.

### Volunteer

Volunteers are assigned to a particular campus. They can only input data for a service time on the day of the actual service time. They only have access to the "Input" page -- not Church settings, dashboards, charts, or anything else.
